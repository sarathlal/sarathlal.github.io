Hey there!

I'm Sarathlal N, a developer from Kerala, India who loves solving problems. I've been doing this for 10 years and enjoy creating better solutions. Currently, I work at [Themehigh](https://www.themehigh.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a Technical Lead.

### My Journey

I started coding because I was curious about how things work. Over time, I've learned a lot and worked on projects that I'm proud of.

### Why I Love What I Do

I consider myself an average programmer, but I excel at finding answers quickly through searches and have recently mastered using AI tools. When I solve someone's problems using a computer and the internet, the dopamine rush I get from that moment is awesome. That feeling keeps me passionate about the field of the internet and computers.

### My Strengths

- WordPress Theme Development
- WordPress Plugin Development
- Ecommerce Development with WooCommerce, Magento & Shopify
- Automating Tasks
- Cleaning Data
- Performance Auditing & Optimization Tips for Web
- Using AI Tools for Development
- Business Tools Integration
- Technical Support

### Beyond Development

Outside of development, I have experience in:

- Working in Canva to Create Posters
- Photography
- Ecommerce Photography
- Content Creation Using AI Tools
- Gardening
- Farming

These activities help me stay balanced and bring new ideas to my work.
