# Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

## What Are Containers?
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Containers ensure that an application behaves the same way, regardless of the environment in which it runs.

### Key Benefits of Containers:
- **Portability**: Run consistently across different environments.
- **Isolation**: Each container operates independently.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them faster and more resource-efficient than virtual machines.

---

## Why Docker?
Docker is a platform that simplifies creating, deploying, and managing containers. It has revolutionized software development and deployment with its ease of use and integration capabilities.

### Key Features of Docker:
1. **Ease of Use**: Docker’s simple commands and tools allow developers to containerize applications quickly.
2. **Docker Hub**: A vast library of prebuilt images for common applications and services.
3. **Scalability**: Seamlessly integrates with orchestration tools to manage large-scale deployments.
4. **Version Control**: Track and manage changes to Docker images.

---

## Why Kubernetes?
While Docker helps create and manage containers, Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that manages containers at scale. Developed by Google, Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Key Features of Kubernetes:
1. **Orchestration**: Manages multiple containers across clusters.
2. **Self-Healing**: Automatically replaces failed containers.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic to ensure reliability and performance.
4. **Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of running containers based on resource usage.
5. **Declarative Management**: Define desired states using configuration files.

---

## Containers vs. Virtual Machines
| Feature               | Containers                          | Virtual Machines                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Resource Usage**    | Lightweight, share host OS kernel   | Heavier, each has its own OS        |
| **Startup Time**      | Milliseconds                        | Minutes                             |
| **Portability**       | Highly portable                     | Limited portability                 |
| **Performance**       | Near-native                         | Slower due to overhead              |

---

## Use Cases for Docker and Kubernetes
1. **Microservices Architecture**: Deploy and manage microservices independently.
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate testing and deployment pipelines.
3. **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Run applications across multiple cloud providers seamlessly.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Efficiently utilize resources for running applications.

## Running Your First Container

### Pulling an Image:
Docker uses images as templates to create containers. For example, to pull the official Nginx image, run:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Running the Container:
To create and run a container from the Nginx image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```
Explanation:
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see Nginx running.

### Listing Running Containers:
View all running containers using:
```bash
docker ps
```

### Stopping a Container:
To stop the Nginx container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

### Removing a Container:
To remove the stopped container:
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

---

## Key Docker Commands
- `docker run`: Run a new container.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker stop`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm`: Remove a stopped container.
- `docker images`: List all downloaded images.
- `docker rmi <image_id>`: Remove an image.
- `docker logs <container>`: View logs from a container.
- `docker exec`: Execute a command inside a running container.

---

## Docker Terminology
1. **Image**: A read-only template with instructions for creating containers.
2. **Container**: A runnable instance of an image.
3. **Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.
4. **Docker Hub**: A repository for storing and sharing Docker images.
5. **Volume**: A persistent storage mechanism for containers.

---

## Hands-On Practice
1. **Run a Simple Application**:
   - Pull and run an official Python image.
   ```bash
   docker run -it python
   ```
   - Test Python commands interactively in the container.

2. **Explore Logs**:
   - Run a container and inspect its logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

3. **Clean Up**:
   - Remove unused images and containers:
   ```bash
   docker system prune
   ```

---

In the next chapter, we will explore how to build and manage Docker images using Dockerfiles to create custom containers tailored to your applications.

# Chapter 2: Docker Basics

In this chapter, we will cover the fundamental concepts and commands of Docker, focusing on running, managing, and interacting with containers. By the end, you will understand how to use Docker to containerize and run applications.

---

## Understanding Docker Components
Before diving into commands, let's explore the essential components of Docker:

1. **Docker Engine**: The core service that runs containers.
2. **Image**: A read-only template that contains the instructions and dependencies to create a container.
3. **Container**: A runnable instance of an image.
4. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where Docker images can be stored and shared.

---

## Running Your First Container
The simplest way to start with Docker is by running a container based on a prebuilt image.

### Step 1: Pull an Image
Use the `docker pull` command to download an image from Docker Hub. For example:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Step 2: Run a Container
Run the container using the `docker run` command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```
Explanation:
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 80 inside the container.
- `nginx`: The image name.

Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see the Nginx server running.

### Step 3: List Running Containers
Use the `docker ps` command to list all running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```

---

## Managing Containers
Docker provides commands to interact with and manage containers effectively.

### Stop a Container
To stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

### Start a Container
To restart a stopped container:
```bash
docker start <container_id>
```

### Remove a Container
To remove a stopped container:
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

### Viewing Logs
To view the logs of a running container:
```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

### Execute Commands Inside a Container
To execute a command inside a running container:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> <command>
```
For example, to open a bash shell inside a container:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```

---

## Working with Docker Images
Images are the foundation of containers. Here are some essential image management commands:

### List All Images
View all images on your system:
```bash
docker images
```

### Remove an Image
To delete an image:
```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

---

## Persistent Data with Volumes
Containers are ephemeral, meaning their data is lost when they stop. Docker volumes provide a way to persist data.

### Creating a Volume
Create a volume with:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

### Mounting a Volume
To mount a volume when running a container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v my_volume:/data nginx
```
Explanation:
- `-v my_volume:/data`: Maps the volume `my_volume` to the `/data` directory inside the container.

### List Volumes
List all Docker volumes:
```bash
docker volume ls
```

---

## Cleaning Up Docker Resources
Over time, unused containers, images, and volumes can take up space. Docker provides cleanup commands:

### Remove All Stopped Containers
```bash
docker container prune
```

### Remove Unused Images
```bash
docker image prune
```

### Remove Unused Volumes
```bash
docker volume prune
```

### Remove All Unused Resources
```bash
docker system prune
```

---

## Hands-On Practice
1. **Run and Explore a Container**:
   - Run a Python container interactively:
   ```bash
   docker run -it python
   ```
   - Test some Python commands in the container.

2. **Persist Data Using Volumes**:
   - Create and mount a volume for an Nginx container.

3. **Clean Up Resources**:
   - Stop and remove unused containers, images, and volumes.

---

In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into Docker by learning how to build and manage custom images using Dockerfiles.




# Chapter 3: Building and Managing Docker Images

Docker images are the building blocks of containers. They contain the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies required for an application to run. In this chapter, you'll learn how to build, customize, and manage Docker images effectively.

---

## What is a Docker Image?
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and immutable file that includes all the instructions needed to run an application inside a container. Images are built in layers, where each layer represents a set of instructions in a Dockerfile.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Layered Architecture**: Images are composed of multiple layers to optimize storage and improve build efficiency.
- **Read-Only**: Images are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once built.
- **Reusable**: The same image can be used across multiple containers.

---

## Writing a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image.

### Basic Dockerfile Structure:
Here’s an example Dockerfile for a Node.js application:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application source code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Key Instructions:
1. **FROM**: Specifies the base image (e.g., `node:16`).
2. **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
3. **COPY**: Copies files from the host to the container.
4. **RUN**: Executes commands during the image build process (e.g., `npm install`).
5. **EXPOSE**: Informs Docker about the port the application listens on.
6. **CMD**: Defines the default command to execute when a container starts.

---

## Building a Docker Image
To build an image using a Dockerfile, use the `docker build` command.

### Syntax:
```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
```

### Example:
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app:1.0 .
```
- `-t`: Tags the image with a name and version (e.g., `my-node-app:1.0`).
- `.`: Specifies the build context (the current directory).

---

## Managing Docker Images
Once built, Docker images can be listed, inspected, and managed.

### Listing Images:
To view all available images on your system:
```bash
docker images
```

### Inspecting an Image:
To view detailed information about an image:
```bash
docker inspect <image_id>
```

### Removing an Image:
To delete an image from your system:
```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```

### Tagging Images:
To assign a new tag to an existing image:
```bash
docker tag <image_id> <new_name>:<new_tag>
```

---

## Docker Image Optimization
Optimizing Docker images ensures faster builds, smaller image sizes, and efficient deployments.

### Best Practices:
1. **Use Official Base Images**:
   - Start with minimal base images like `alpine` or `debian`.
   - Example: Replace `node:16` with `node:16-alpine` for smaller image sizes.

2. **Leverage Multi-Stage Builds**:
   - Separate the build and runtime stages to exclude unnecessary build tools in the final image.
   - Example Dockerfile:
     ```dockerfile
     # Build Stage
     FROM node:16 as builder
     WORKDIR /usr/src/app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     RUN npm run build

     # Runtime Stage
     FROM node:16-alpine
     WORKDIR /usr/src/app
     COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/dist ./dist
     CMD ["node", "dist/app.js"]
     ```

3. **Minimize Layers**:
   - Combine commands to reduce the number of layers.
   - Example:
     ```dockerfile
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
     ```

4. **Use `.dockerignore` Files**:
   - Exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
   - Example `.dockerignore` file:
     ```
     node_modules
     .git
     Dockerfile
     ```

---

## Pushing Images to Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a public registry for storing and sharing images.

### Steps to Push an Image:
1. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
2. **Tag the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker tag my-node-app:1.0 <username>/my-node-app:1.0
   ```
3. **Push the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker push <username>/my-node-app:1.0
   ```

### Pulling an Image:
To pull the image on another machine:
```bash
docker pull <username>/my-node-app:1.0
```

---

## Hands-On Practice
1. **Build a Custom Image**:
   - Write a Dockerfile for a simple Python Flask app.
   - Build and run the image.

2. **Optimize an Image**:
   - Refactor the Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build.

3. **Push to Docker Hub**:
   - Create an account on Docker Hub.
   - Push the optimized image to your repository.

---

In the next chapter, we will explore Docker networking and volumes to understand how containers communicate and manage persistent storage.

# Chapter 4: Docker Networking and Volumes

In this chapter, we will explore how Docker enables container-to-container communication through networking and how to persist data using Docker volumes. Networking and volumes are crucial for building scalable, stateful, and connected applications in Docker.

---

## Docker Networking
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world. By default, Docker sets up a network when it is installed, but you can create custom networks to meet specific needs.

### Types of Docker Networks
1. **Bridge (default)**: Isolated networks for containers on the same host.
2. **Host**: Shares the host network stack, removing isolation.
3. **None**: No networking, providing a fully isolated container.
4. **Overlay**: Enables communication between containers across multiple hosts (used in Swarm or Kubernetes).
5. **Macvlan**: Assigns a MAC address to each container for direct connectivity to the physical network.

---

### Default Bridge Network
When a container is created without specifying a network, Docker connects it to the default `bridge` network.

#### Inspecting the Default Network:
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

#### Running Containers on the Bridge Network:
```bash
docker run -d --name container1 nginx
```
```bash
docker run -d --name container2 nginx
```
- By default, containers cannot resolve each other’s names. Communication is possible only via IP addresses.

---

### Creating a Custom Bridge Network
Custom networks enable containers to resolve each other by name.

#### Create a Custom Network:
```bash
docker network create my_custom_network
```

#### Run Containers in the Custom Network:
```bash
docker run -d --name app1 --network my_custom_network nginx
```
```bash
docker run -d --name app2 --network my_custom_network nginx
```

#### Test Connectivity:
```bash
docker exec app1 ping app2
```
- Containers can now communicate using container names instead of IP addresses.

---

### Exposing Ports to the Host
To make a container accessible from the host or external systems, use the `-p` flag to map container ports to host ports.

#### Example:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```
- Access the containerized Nginx server at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Docker Volumes
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated or used by containers. Unlike bind mounts, volumes are managed by Docker and are the recommended way to handle persistent data.

### Types of Persistent Storage
1. **Volumes**: Managed by Docker and stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes`.
2. **Bind Mounts**: Map a host directory to a container directory.
3. **tmpfs Mounts**: Temporary storage in memory, removed when the container stops.

---

### Creating and Using Volumes
#### Create a Volume:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

#### Attach a Volume to a Container:
```bash
docker run -d -v my_volume:/app/data nginx
```
- `my_volume` is the name of the volume.
- `/app/data` is the directory inside the container.

#### Inspect a Volume:
```bash
docker volume inspect my_volume
```

---

### Bind Mounts
Bind mounts allow you to map a specific host directory to a container directory.

#### Example:
```bash
docker run -d -v /host/path:/container/path nginx
```
- Changes in `/host/path` will be reflected in `/container/path` inside the container.

---

### Comparing Volumes and Bind Mounts
| Feature            | Volumes                          | Bind Mounts                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Managed By**     | Docker                           | Host                             |
| **Data Location**  | `/var/lib/docker/volumes`        | Specified host directory         |
| **Portability**    | Portable across hosts            | Tied to specific host directories|

---

## Backup and Restore Volumes
### Backing Up Data:
To back up the data in a volume, use a temporary container to copy it to the host:
```bash
docker run --rm -v my_volume:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /data
```

### Restoring Data:
To restore data from a backup:
```bash
docker run --rm -v my_volume:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar xvf /backup/backup.tar -C /data
```

---

## Hands-On Practice
1. **Create a Custom Network**:
   - Create a custom network and connect two containers.
   - Verify communication using `ping`.

2. **Use Volumes for Persistent Storage**:
   - Create a volume and attach it to a container.
   - Verify that data persists after the container stops.

3. **Backup and Restore a Volume**:
   - Back up a volume using `tar`.
   - Restore the volume and verify the data.

---

In the next chapter, we will explore multi-container applications with Docker Compose, enabling you to manage complex deployments with a single configuration file.

# Chapter 5: Multi-Container Applications with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services, networks, and volumes. It simplifies managing multi-container environments, allowing you to start, stop, and scale your application with a single command.

---

## Why Docker Compose?
- **Simplifies Multi-Container Applications**: Define all services in a single file.
- **Reproducibility**: Create consistent development and production environments.
- **Automation**: Start all containers with a single command.
- **Portability**: Share the `docker-compose.yml` file to replicate the environment anywhere.

---

## Installing Docker Compose
Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows. For Linux, install it manually.

### Linux Installation:
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.5.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Verify the installation:
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

---

## Writing a Docker Compose File
A `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, networks, and volumes required for your application.

### Basic Structure:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  service_name:
    image: <image_name>
    ports:
      - "<host_port>:<container_port>"
    volumes:
      - <volume_name>:<container_path>
    environment:
      - VARIABLE=value
networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
volumes:
  volume_name:
```

---

### Example: WordPress with MySQL
Here’s a basic example of a `docker-compose.yml` file to run WordPress with MySQL:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - wp_data:/var/www/html
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
    depends_on:
      - db

volumes:
  db_data:
  wp_data:
```

### Explanation:
1. **Services**: Defines two services (`db` and `wordpress`).
2. **Volumes**: Persists MySQL data and WordPress content.
3. **Ports**: Maps port `80` in the container to port `8080` on the host.
4. **Environment**: Sets environment variables for database and WordPress configuration.
5. **depends_on**: Ensures the `db` service starts before `wordpress`.

---

## Using Docker Compose

### Starting the Application
To start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Use the `-d` flag to run in detached mode:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Application
To stop and remove all containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Viewing Logs
To view logs from all services:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```
To view logs from a specific service:
```bash
docker-compose logs <service_name>
```

### Scaling Services
Docker Compose can scale services horizontally:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale <service_name>=<count>
```
Example:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale wordpress=3
```

---

## Networking in Docker Compose
Docker Compose automatically creates a default bridge network for all services.
- Services can communicate using their service names (e.g., `db` and `wordpress`).
- To define custom networks:

```yaml
networks:
  my_network:
    driver: bridge

services:
  service_name:
    networks:
      - my_network
```

---

## Docker Compose Commands
| Command                           | Description                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `docker-compose up`              | Start all services.                         |
| `docker-compose down`            | Stop and remove all services.               |
| `docker-compose logs`            | View logs for all services.                 |
| `docker-compose ps`              | List running services.                      |
| `docker-compose exec`            | Execute a command in a running service.     |
| `docker-compose build`           | Build or rebuild services.                  |
| `docker-compose config`          | Validate and view the configuration.        |
