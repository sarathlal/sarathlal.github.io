The WooCommerce is an awesome WordPress E-Commerce plugin that help us to sell online with minimal effort. In the WooCommerce home page, it say that WooCommerce now powers 28% of all online stores world wide.

Same like me, I believe that your store is one that already included in this 28%. Else you may be in the planing of starting an online store with WooCommerce.

If so, below you can find a good list of essential & usable WooCommerce shortcodes that help us to sell more.

### Display 4 popular products with discount pice

	[products limit="4" columns="4" orderby="popularity" on_sale="true" ]
