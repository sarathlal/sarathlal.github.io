In one of my recent WooCommerce project, I have to show some custom message on variation selection in product detail page as per selected variation.

I have checked few options and finally find out some interesting jQuery events in WooCommerce `add-to-cart-variation.js`. The WooCommerce provides triggers throughout the `add-to-cart-variation.js` which allows us to hook into change events.

Below you can find two jQuery events that fire after user select a variation using drop down options. The details about the variation is also available as an object.

	$( ".single_variation_wrap" ).on( "show_variation", function ( event, variation ) {
		alert( variation.variation_id );
		console.log( variation );
	} );


	$( document ).on( "found_variation.first", function ( e, v ) {
		alert( v.variation_id );
		console.log( v );
	} );

Just check your console and you can see whole data like variation price, image, stock status etc.

Additionally, if you have to do some on variation option selection, use below event.
  
	$( ".variations_form" ).on( "woocommerce_variation_select_change", function () {
		alert( "Options changed" );
	} );

The `woocommerce_variation_select_change` Fires when the select is changed.
