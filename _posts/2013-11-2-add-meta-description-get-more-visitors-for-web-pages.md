The meta description is an important HTML attribute in web pages. They can provide a preformatted tiny explanation about our content in SERP (Search Engine Result Pages) as a preview snippet for given page.

When we search some things in a search engine like Google, they normally provide heading of web pages as a link & a small description below it in result pages. This description is the end product of HTML meta description tag.

### Code example with Meta description tag

	<head>
	<meta name="description" content="This description is called meta description. This will often show up in search results">
	</head>

The meta description is not a compulsory element for web pages. If our web page have content in meta description tag, Search engine normally display these content as description in search result.

In some special cases, Search engines display a part of meta description with some lines from our web pages. If we don't have a meta description at all, Search engines display some random line of texts from our web pages related with search word.

Currently, these descriptions don't have any direct impact on SEO. But if we can craft these description like a brief introduction about our content, we can gain more visitors through Search Engines Result Pages.
