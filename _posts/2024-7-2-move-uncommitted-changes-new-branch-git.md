When working in Git, you might find yourself needing to move uncommitted changes from one branch to another. This guide explains how to do so using straightforward methods, ensuring your development process remains organized and your codebase stays clean.

## Why Move Uncommitted Changes?

Moving changes can be necessary when you start work in the wrong branch or decide that your changes are more suited for a separate branch. This step ensures that your project's history is clean and the codebase well-organized, facilitating easier management and future developments.

## Method 1: Stashing Changes

### Step 1: Stash Your Changes
Stashing is ideal for temporary changes that you want to move quickly without adding them to the branch history.

```bash
git stash
```

### Step 2: Apply Changes to the New Branch
Switch to the new branch where you want to apply these changes. If it doesn't exist, Git can create it during the checkout process.

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
git stash pop
```

## Method 2: Committing Changes

For more significant changes that you intend to preserve in the branch history, committing them before moving can be more appropriate.

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes
Secure your changes in the `dev` branch with a temporary commit.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Temp commit of changes"
```

### Step 2: Transfer and Reset
Switch to your new branch, bringing all recent commits along.

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

Return to your `dev` branch and reset it to the desired state using the commit hash identified from the log:

```bash
git checkout dev
git log
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Commit Frequently:** Regularly commit your work to minimize the risk of losing substantial changes.
- **Use Descriptive Branch Names:** Clearly name your branches to reflect their purpose, improving clarity and management.
- **Keep Branches Updated:** Frequently pull changes from your main branch to reduce merge conflicts and keep branches current.

Understanding how to manage uncommitted changes effectively using Git tools like stashing and committing can significantly enhance your workflow. By following these steps, you can ensure your development environment remains clean and organized, ready for any task.
