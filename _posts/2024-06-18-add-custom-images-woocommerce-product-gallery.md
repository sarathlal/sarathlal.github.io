Adding custom images to the WooCommerce product gallery can enhance the visual appeal and provide more information to potential buyers. This guide demonstrates how we can use the `woocommerce_product_get_gallery_image_ids` filter to add custom images to WooCommerce product gallery dynamically.

### Step 1: Upload the Custom Image as an Attachment

1. Upload the image to the Media Library.
2. Retrieve its attachment ID. This can be done by clicking on the image in the Media Library and checking the URL in the browser's address bar, which includes `post=123`, where `123` is the attachment ID.

### Step 2: Add the Custom Image to the Product Gallery

First, add the following code snippet to our child themeâ€™s `functions.php` file. This code will append a custom image to the product gallery of a specific product.

```php
function add_custom_image_to_product_gallery( $gallery_image_ids, $product ) {
    // Check if the product is the one we want to add the custom image to
    if ( $product->get_id() === 123 ) { // Replace 123 with our product ID
        // Custom image ID (must be an attachment ID)
        $custom_image_id = 456; // Replace 456 with our custom image attachment ID
        
        // Add the custom image to the end of the gallery
        $gallery_image_ids[] = $custom_image_id;
    }

    return $gallery_image_ids;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_get_gallery_image_ids', 'add_custom_image_to_product_gallery', 10, 2 );
```

### How it works

1. **Filter Hook:** The `woocommerce_product_get_gallery_image_ids` filter hook allows us to modify the array of gallery image IDs for a product.
2. **Condition:** The function checks if the current product matches the specified product ID.
3. **Add Custom Image:** The custom image attachment ID is appended to the array of gallery image IDs.
4. **Return Updated Gallery:** The updated array of gallery image IDs is returned.

### Complete Example for All Products

If we want to add a custom image to the gallery of all products, use the following code snippet:

```php
function add_custom_image_to_all_product_galleries( $gallery_image_ids, $product ) {
    // Custom image ID (must be an attachment ID)
    $custom_image_id = 456; // Replace 456 with our custom image attachment ID
    
    // Add the custom image to the end of the gallery
    $gallery_image_ids[] = $custom_image_id;

    return $gallery_image_ids;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_get_gallery_image_ids', 'add_custom_image_to_all_product_galleries', 10, 2 );
```

In this example, the custom image is added to the gallery of all products. Adjust the conditions as needed for specific products.

By leveraging the `woocommerce_product_get_gallery_image_ids` filter, we can dynamically add custom images to our WooCommerce product galleries. This method provides flexibility and control over our product presentations, enhancing the overall shopping experience for our customers.
